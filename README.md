# DS4Windows Standalone

DS4Windows (https://github.com/Jays2Kings/DS4Windows) is a portable program that allows you to get the best experience while using a DualShock 4 on your PC. By emulating a Xbox 360 controller, many more games are accessible.

This is a personal project, and I'm not related with Jays2Kings (https://github.com/Jays2Kings/) or PortableApps (https://portableapps.com).
Only unpack and enjoy (unpack in PortableApps folder to integrate with him).

This is packed with DS4Windows v1.4.52 and ScpDriver v1.2.2.175 (Install mannually), works on Windows XP up to Windows 10 (21H2).
